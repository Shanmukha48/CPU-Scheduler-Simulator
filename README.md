**🖥️ CPU Scheduler Simulator 💡**

The **CPU Scheduler Simulator** is a fun and interactive tool that helps you understand how operating systems manage multiple processes! 🧠⚙️

With this simulator, you can:
- 📋 **Input custom processes** with arrival time, burst time, and priority  
- ⏱️ **Choose from scheduling algorithms** like:
  - FCFS (First-Come First-Served) 🥇  
  - SJF (Shortest Job First) ⚡  
  - Priority Scheduling 🔢  
  - Round Robin 🔄  
- 📊 **Visualize execution** using dynamic Gantt charts  
- 🧮 **Calculate key performance metrics** like:
  - Waiting Time ⌛  
  - Turnaround Time 🔁  
  - CPU Utilization 💯  

Perfect for students 👨‍🎓👩‍🎓, developers 👨‍💻👩‍💻, and anyone curious about how CPUs make scheduling decisions! Dive in and see how different algorithms perform in real time. 🚀
